# Contributing

## Introduction

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!. All types of contributions
are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before
making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers to
make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved.

The Project Team looks forward to your contributions.

## Contribute Documentation

Documentation is a super important, critical part of this project. Docs are how
we keep track of what we're doing, how, and why. It's how we stay on the same
page about our policies. And it's how we tell others everything they need in
order to be able to use this project -- or contribute to it. So thank you in
advance.

Documentation contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even
if you're just rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling
mistake!

To contribute documentation:

* Edit or add any relevant documentation.
* Make sure your changes are formatted correctly and consistently with the rest
of the documentation.
* Re-read what you wrote, and run a spellchecker on it to make sure you didn't
miss anything.
* Write clear, concise commit message(s). Documentation commits should use
`docs: <message>`.
* Go to <https://github.com/inigochoa/wiki/pulls> and open a new pull request
with your changes.
* If your PR is connected to an open issue, add a line in your PR's description
that says `Fixes: #123`, where `#123` is the number of the issue you're fixing.

Once you've filed the PR:

* One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for
another review.
* If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the
contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We
still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that
lightly.
* If your PR gets accepted, it will be marked as such, and merged into the
`main` branch soon after.
